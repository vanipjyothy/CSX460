# NYCFlights Model

Using the rectangular data that you created last week create a model for `arr_delay`. Follow a well defined process for creating a model as discussed in class or from one of the readings. 

Break the process down into steps and create a codeblock for each step. 
 - Use as many steps you feel as necessary
 - Concisely explain each step 
 - Show all work
 
(You can start with the data that you created last week.)


## Step 1: [Step Name] 

```{
model3=lm(arr_delay ~ visib +precip++humid+dewp+temp+month.x + day.x + dep_time + sched_dep_time+dep_delay+arr_time+sched_arr_time+carrier+origin+dest+air_time + distance,data=Aviation)


summary(model3)
}

```
## Step 2: [Step Name] 

```{
model4=lm(arr_delay ~ visib +precip+humid+temp+dep_delay+arr_time+carrier+origin+dest+air_time+sched_arr_time ,data=Aviation,na.action = na.omit)


summary(model4)
}

```
# Question:

Is this a good model?  (Write your answer here.)

Model have good R-Squared and Adjusted R-squared value.
All the variables used in the model are significant.
Minimum independent variables used
